# Simple-Chat-Bot-Using-AI-

Building a chatbot can sound daunting, but it’s totally possible one. AI Chatbot Framework is an AI powered conversational dialog interface built in Python.Though it is a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills, it's a good way to get into NLP and know about chatbots.Here , we are using retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for choosing the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialogue tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g., username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.However, "chat Bot " responds to user input. It won’t fool your friends, and for a production system, you’ll want to consider one of the existing bot platforms or frameworks, but this example should help you think through the design and challenge of creating a chatbot.
